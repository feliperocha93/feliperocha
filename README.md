# Summary

This project is a personal resume ready to scalate to a personal blog (but i don't really believe in that ðŸ˜‚).
I developed it to try out some new features of nextjs 13 and I need to pratice some new concepts I learned about clean architecture.
In addition to this summary, the README contains an explain on how I defined the architecture and below it I left the Next documentation part on how to run a next project.

npm run dev
# or

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
